In order to use this script you have to install the MEmu emulator
Also you will have to have the numbers you want to try and scrape saved in a csv file in the same directory!
after installing MEmu emulator you have to install viber and link it with your number and before you start the script make sure that the only two windows open on your computer are MEmu Emulator(make sure before starting that you are at the contacts menu on Viber App) and the Script 

Also you will need to setup the cordinates of the buttons which I commented on the script method using the cordinates.py script 




Warning: 
This script is for educational purposes only. I don't hold any responsibility for any damage you do to your Viber account or for anything else you might use this script for!!!!!!!!!
